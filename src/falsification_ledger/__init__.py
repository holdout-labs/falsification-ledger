"""falsification-ledger: pre-registration and falsification ledger.

A hash-chained, append-only JSONL ledger for research claims: register the
hypothesis and the evidence that would kill it *before* running the study,
submit evidence, adjudicate, and report hit-rate with a Wilson confidence
interval against a random baseline. Every event is content-addressed and
chain-verified; nothing here trades, prices, or decides.
